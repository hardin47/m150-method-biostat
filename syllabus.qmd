## The course 

**Methods in Biostatistics**  is a second course in biostatistics, designed to follow either an Introduction to Statistics or Introduction to Biostatistics course. No biology background is needed, but examples and methods will be focused on those found in the life sciences. In particular, the main statistical topics covered include a logistic regression, survival analysis, and methods to ameliorate multiple comparison issues.

## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the semester, students will be able to do the following:

* evaluate quantitative information with regards to clinical and biological data. We’ll be sure to keep in mind:
   - Careful presentation of data
   - Consideration of variability
   - Meaningful comparisons
* critically evaluate the medical literature with respect to design, analysis, and interpretation of results.
* understand the role of inherent variability and keep it in perspective when inferring results to a population.
* critically evaluate medical results given in the mainstream media.
* read published studies with skepticism. Some people (in all fields!) wrongly believe that all studies published in a peer review publication must be 100% accurate and/or well designed studies. In this course, you will learn the tools to recognize, interpret, and critique statistical results in medical literature.


## Inclusion Goals^[adapted from Monica Linden, Brown University]

In an ideal world, science would be objective. However, much of science is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of privileged voices. In this class, we will make an effort to recognize how science (and statistics!) has played a role in both understanding diversity as well as in promoting systems of power and privilege. I acknowledge that there may be both overt and covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even though the material is primarily of a scientific nature. Integrating a diverse set of experiences is important for a more comprehensive understanding of science. I would like to discuss issues of diversity in statistics as part of the course from time to time.

Please contact me if you have any suggestions to improve the quality of the course materials.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:

* If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records, please let me know!
* If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me.  You can also relay information to me via your mentors.  I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the math liaisons, Dean of Students, or QSC staff are all excellent resources.

I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.  As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.

#### Using R (through the RStudio IDE)

R will be used for all homework assignments.
You can use R on the Pomona server: <a href = "https://rstudio.pomona.edu/" target = "_blank">https://rstudio.pomona.edu/</a> (All Pomona students will be able to log in immediately.
Non-Pomona students need to get Pomona login information.)

Alternatively, feel free to download R onto your own computer.
R is freely available at <a href = "http://www.r-project.org/" target = "_blank">http://www.r-project.org/</a> and is already installed on college computers.
Additionally, you are required to install RStudio and turn in all R assignments using Quarto. <a href = "http://rstudio.org/" target = "_blank">http://rstudio.org/</a>.
(You can use the LaTeX compiler at:  <a href = "https://yihui.name/tinytex/" target = "_blank">https://yihui.name/tinytex/</a>)



## Important Features

#### Prerequisites:

The prerequisites for this class are Introductory Statistics (Math 58 or equivalent) and completion of one semester of calculus. We rely heavily on these prerequisites, and students with no background in statistics or very light mathematics background will find themselves trying to catch up throughout the semester. You should be familiar with topics such as probability, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, p-values, linear regression.

##### Homework 

Homework will be assigned from the text and due every Thursday at 11:59pm.
One homework grade will be automatically dropped, so there are no late assignments.
Homework will be turned in via Gradescope on Canvas.


Homework assignments will be graded out of 5 points, which are based on a combination of accuracy and effort. Below are rough guidelines for grading.

[5] All problems completed with detailed solutions provided and 75% or more of the problems are fully correct. Additionally, there are no extraneous messages, warnings, or printed lists of numbers.  
[4] All problems completed with detailed solutions and 50-75% correct; OR close to all problems completed and 75%-100% correct. Or all problems are completed and there are extraneous messages, warnings, or printed lists of numbers.  
[3] Close to all problems completed with less than 75% correct. OR an assignment that didn't make it all the way to Canvas as the correctly rendered pdf.  
[2] More than half but fewer than all problems completed and > 75% correct.  
[1] More than half but fewer than all problems completed and < 75% correct; OR less than half of problems completed.  
[0] No work submitted, OR half or less than half of the problems submitted and without any detail/work shown to explain the solutions. You will get a zero if your file is not compiled and submitted on GitHub.  




#### Project:

There will be one project at the end of the semester based primarily on the survival analysis material. You will be able to work in pairs or alone.  More information to come on the project.

#### Academic Honesty:

Throughout the semester, you will be challenged, and you may find yourself stuck.
Every single one of us has been there, I promise.
Below, I've provided Pomona's academic honesty policy.  But before the policy, I've given some thoughts on cheating which I have taken from Nick Ball's CHEM 147 Collective (thank you, Prof Ball!).
Prof Ball gives us all something to think about when we are learning in a classroom as well as on our journey to become scientists and professionals:

## Why Cheat?
There are many known reasons why we may feel the need to "cheat" on problem sets or exams:

* An academic environment that values grades above learning.
* Financial aid is critical for remaining in school that places undue pressure on maintaining a high GPA.
* Navigating school, work, and/or family obligations that  have diverted focus from class.
* Challenges balancing coursework and mental health.
* Balancing academic, family, peer, or personal issues.

Being accused of cheating – whether it has occurred or not – can be devastating for students. The college requires me to respond to potential academic dishonesty with a process that is very long and damaging. As your instructor, I care about you and want to offer alternatives to prevent us from having to go through this process.
:::

If you find yourself in a situation where "cheating" seems like the only option, please come talk to me.  We will figure this out together.

Pomona College is an academic community, all of whose members are expected to abide by ethical standards both in their conduct and in their exercise of responsibilities toward other members of the community. The college expects students to understand and adhere to basic standards of honesty and academic integrity. These standards include, but are not limited to, the following:

* In projects and assignments prepared independently, students never represent the ideas or the language of others as their own.
* Students do not destroy or alter either the work of other students or the educational resources and materials of the College.
* Students neither give nor receive assistance in examinations.
* Students do not take unfair advantage of fellow students by representing work completed for one course as original work for another or by deliberately disregarding course rules and regulations.
* In laboratory or research projects involving the collection of data, students accurately report data observed and do not alter these data for any reason.

## AI use policy^[Many of the ideas below are from https://provost.tufts.edu/celt/online-resources/artificial-intelligence/ai-syllabus-statements/]

If you choose to use AI for any of the assignments for this class, you should pay attention to where you obtained any relevant information.
Submitting work created by a generative AI as your own in any assignment is considered plagiarism, and therefore an academic integrity violation, just the same as copying work from any other source.

**Attribution**

* As with any other reference you might find, any directly copied text from generative AI should be in quotes and given a citation. Any summarized text from generative AI should be referenced.
* Cite all AI tools when used or referred to in assigned work.  For example, see how to cite generative AI in <a href = "https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt" target = "_blank">APA</a>, <a href = "https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/" target = "_blank">MLA</a>, or <a href = "https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Documentation/faq0422.html" target = "_blank">Chicago</a> styles. 

**Permitted**

* Clarifying concepts (after attempting to understand them yourself, and then checking course materials or other credible sources for accuracy)
* Brainstorming initial topic ideas or approaches (after you have spent some time thinking on your own)
* Organizing and outlining your thoughts
* Grammar and spelling assistance
* Asking AI for practice questions or explanations of concepts (after attempting them yourself first), then checking your understanding against course materials
* Using AI to generate examples, counterarguments, or alternative perspectives that help you develop more nuanced thinking
* Debugging code, checking syntax, or troubleshooting errors (with the expectation that you understand and can explain any code you submit)

**Not permitted**

* Having AI generate any sentences or paragraphs that appear in your final work without quotation marks and attribution
* Using AI to write arguments, code, proofs, or problem solutions that you submit as your own
* Asking AI to outline or structure your assignment before you have developed your own approach
* Using AI to summarize readings or course materials in place of doing the reading yourself
* Submitting code (or full chunks of code) that has been written in whole by AI

#### Advice:

Please email and / or set up a time to talk if you have any questions about or difficulty with the material, the computing, or the course.  Talk to me as soon as possible if you find yourself struggling. The material will build on itself, so it will be much easier to catch up if the concepts get clarified earlier rather than later.  This semester is going to be fun.  Let's do it.


## Philosophy on AI use

The goals of the course including **learning** core content and becoming skilled at using analysis tools accurately and effectively. While sometimes quite helpful, there are ways that AI can get in the way of the **learning**, for example:

* Learning takes struggle, and LLMs often remove the struggle.
* AI will often be wrong, maybe because it doesn't understand the prompt or maybe because it is hallucinating.
* Learning takes practice, particularly by building muscles related to creative and independent thinking. LLMs remove the practice.

There are also ways that AI can be **ethically problematic**, for example:

* LLM queries use large amounts of resources.
* LLMs are based on intellectual property (often illegally) taken from scholars, artists, and journalists.
* The rise of LLMs impact the number of jobs available to people like you.

I encourage you to reflect on your use of AI in this class and elsewhere. Is your use consistent with the **learning** that brings you to a place like Pomona College? Are you considering the **ethical ramifications** associated with using AI?  See the academic honesty part of the syllabus for generative AI policy.
