### Assignment Summary (Goals)

-   building Cox PH models
-   checking proportional hazards
-   interpreting coefficients in the Cox PH model

## Important

The data are in the files tab on Canvas (in a folder called "data"). 

#### Q1. Collaborative Learning

Describe one thing you learned from someone (a fellow student or mentor) in our class this week (it could be: content, logistical help, background material, R information, etc.)  1-3 sentences.

#### Q2. Chp 9, E11

Read text for description of data.

(a) check proportional hazard assumptions for treatment KM curves. Use `fun="cloglog"` inside the `ggsurvplot`. (We will cover checking PH in Tuesday's class.)

(b) use all explanatory variables and likelihood ratio test to come up with the "best" model. [Note that the structure of the likelihood ratio test here is identical to the one we used in logistic regression! See: <http://st47s.com/Math150/Notes/survival-analysis.html#multcoxph>]

-   After you pipe the `coxph()` model into `glance()` you will see a column called `logLik`.
-   The test statistics is $G = 2*(logLik_{bigger model} - logLik_{smaller model})$
-   `Type` and `Partners` are related and probably should not be thought of as numeric (instead they should be factor variables). That said, there are not 9 unique groups (3x3) so to use both, the six groups need to be defined:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fruitfly <- read_csv("https://pomona.box.com/shared/static/qnsl0sp0twdutz6azidxb5yt37boee7v", na="*") %>%
  mutate(Type_Partners = case_when(
    Partners == 0 ~ "0zero",
    Partners == 1 & Type == 0 ~ "1P0T",
    Partners == 8 & Type == 0 ~ "8P0T",
    Partners == 1 & Type == 1 ~ "1P1T",
    Partners == 8 & Type == 1 ~ "8P1T"
  ))
```

-   The p-value will be calculated using a chisq distribution where the degrees of freedom are the number of extra coefficients which were estimated in the bigger model.

(c) using the final model, interpret each of the coefficients (in terms of hazard ratios). Don't forget that when a model has multiple variables, the coefficient estimate will be interpreted while keeping all other variables constant.

#### Q3. Chp 9, E12

Read text for description of data.

(a) check proportional hazard assumptions for treatment KM curves. Use `fun="cloglog"` inside the `ggsurvplot`. And/or use `cox.zph`. (We will cover checking PH in Tuesday's class.)

(b) use all explanatory variables and likelihood ratio test to come up with the "best" model.

(c) using the final model, interpret each of the coefficients (in terms of hazard ratios). Don't forget that when a model has multiple variables, the coefficient estimate will be interpreted while keeping all other variables constant.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
VAlung <- read_csv("https://pomona.box.com/shared/static/r6hoo1gawopkt0526xvwwze5fl3245de",
                     na="*")
```
